## A Look back at 2024

&nbsp;
2024 might have been the toughest year of my life. I did learn a lot about myself. Being resilient and consistent is important. I'm not sure how many jobs that I applied too that I got rejected from in 2024. It was a lot for sure.

&nbsp;

## Looking ahead to 2025

&nbsp;
Looking ahead to 2025 I really hope its better then 2024. The last 2 years have been tough for sure but I hope the tide turns here soon.

&nbsp;

## Goals

&nbsp;
My goals for 2025 are:

&nbsp;

```

- Get a job
- Continue to walk/exercise
- Eat better
- Stop doom scrolling
- Be a better person
- Continue to learn go 
```

&nbsp;

## Conclusion

&nbsp;
My goal with this post is mostly for me to look back at this and to see how far I've come.
