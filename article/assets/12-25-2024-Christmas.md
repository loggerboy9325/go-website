## Story About the Picture

&nbsp;
The story behind the picture above is that I took that picture on Christmas day of 2013. It's kinda weird how time flies and how life can change.

&nbsp;
That winter was a cold one too. Temperatures were sometimes down to -20 degrees Fahrenheit. That job was mostly ash trees that were harvested because of the emerald ash borer.  

&nbsp;

## Overview

&nbsp;
My Overview of Christmas was mostly positive. Went down to my aunts like usual and got some presents. My day didn't start the best though.

&nbsp;

## Current Trends in Tech

&nbsp;
It seems like there is a lot of people that market their classes on youtube. They claim you could be a software engineer in 3 months which is bullshit. People tell you hey get these certifications and you can get a job. Which is very debatable. I don't think jobs even look for certifications anymore.

&nbsp;
They value experience but in my case how do I get experience if I can't get a job. I'm thinking about maybe if I can reformat my resume for like the 100th time. Probably won't work but I guess I can say I tried.

&nbsp;
I'm really interested to see if the tech market picks up at the beginning of the year. Seems like that's usually when things start to pick up but this market is different.

&nbsp;
My personal predication is that it picks up but not very much. This tech job market is not kind, not kind at all. I'm not sure if I see a rebound either. But I guess we will see.

&nbsp;
Like I stated in previous posts I have pivoted to desktop support positions. My plan is to not get my hopes up because every time I do I get let down.

&nbsp;
I've looked at some go jobs but I don't think my go skill level is up to par with a lot of the job postings. It seems like my direction is probably getting a job that's not tech related because I just need the money.

&nbsp;

## Conclusion

&nbsp;
I think my Christmas was overall good. I am grateful for my family and friends who have supported me. Especially these last 2 years that were really rough. I also sometime need to implement code to organize my posts by day as well.
