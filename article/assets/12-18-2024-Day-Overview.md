## Overview

&nbsp;
I'm feeling sick today but I still took my walk. I applied to a couple jobs today. I will admit the last few days were hard mentally. Not having a job for a extending period of time is taking a toll on me. Also being alone for most of my life is also taking a toll.

&nbsp;
It almost feels like I'm living the same day over and over again. I didn't think my life would end up like this. I thought by the time I was 25 I would have everything figured out. Looks like I was wrong. I will say getting denied for jobs is really taking a toll as well.

&nbsp;

## Breaking-The-Habit

&nbsp;
There's a couple habits I need to break. Right now I'm drinking way to much coffee. I need to get on a better sleep schedule. I also need to start    thinking more positively. I'm doom scrolling way to much. I haven't learned much go either over the past couple days. My motivation has diminished quite a bit.

&nbsp;

## Conclusion

&nbsp;
Not really much to write today. I've been pretty depressed and unmotivated. Hopefully that will change somehow. All the jobs I've applied to over the past 2 years and not 1 interview is basically the story for me at this point.
