## Overview

&nbsp;
Last couple days have been really meh. Really hard to stay motivated. Between not having much money and relying on my family plus getting denied for jobs is taking its toll.

&nbsp;
Its 2 days before Christmas which is good I guess. I'm trying to feel excited for Christmas but its just hard because of the current state of my life at the moment.

&nbsp;

## Job-Search

&nbsp;
Current job search situation hasn't changed much. A couple jobs I applied to last week were local IT desktop jobs maybe since its local maybe there won't be much competition. The tech market is in a really weird state right now seems like a lot of people are looked for jobs, even talented people are.

&nbsp;
I will admit that I'm not sure how much longer I will try to break-in to the tech market. A lot of people recommended to get AWS certs and I'll be honest they haven't really helped me at all so far maybe that will change. I've tried for 2 years to get in to a tech job and 0 interviews.

&nbsp;
There's more things I could of done these past 2 years for sure. Sometimes I do miss working in the woods. Sometimes I wish maybe I could've spent more time learning to code some days as well.

&nbsp;
I think I'm going to have to start really applying to local jobs that are not even tech related. I'm still having a hard time accepting the fact that I couldn't even sniff a interview with amazon for a data center tech role. It seems like even amazon doesn't really value AWS certs and personal projects.

&nbsp;

## Conclusion

&nbsp;
This post was more of a vent session of frustration about my current life and my job search. There should be more positive posts soon
