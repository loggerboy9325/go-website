## Data Center Technician

&nbsp;
Amazon just opened up a data center near me and I thought it would be a perfect job.
I thought with my AWS certificates and my personal experience I would have the hard
skills to at least get a interview.
&nbsp;
Seems like I was wrong unfortunately. I even went to a virtual event about data center
roles and that really didn't seem to help. I did appreciate what the recruiter did for
me the one who hosted the virtual event.
&nbsp;
I did end up reapplying so not sure what will happen but I didn't think I would have to scratch and claw to get an interview. Right at the moment it doesn't even seem like
I can get a interview.
&nbsp;
I'm not sure what that next thing for me to do is as far as job but I'm not sure giving
up is an option. I have put in time to up skill myself and even though the last 2 years
might be the worst 2 years of my life I have to find ways to motivate myself.
&nbsp;
I might have to pivot and find a job for the time being because not having money really
isn't good obviously.

## Mental Health

&nbsp;
My mental-health at the moment is bit fragile. Whats bothering me is thinking that my AWS
certificates might almost be worthless. These last 2 years my certificates haven't really
helped me it seems.
&nbsp;
obviously this has played a huge role in me being really unmotivated because of so much
denial when it comes to jobs. I really thought I had something with the data-center-technician role so not being able to get even a interview really kinda put things into
perspective I guess you can say.
&nbsp;
There's a part of me that is still somewhat hopeful but then there's a part of me that
is not so hopeful.
&nbsp;

## Next Steps

&nbsp;
I think my next steps are I need to focus on things that make me feel better like exercise.
I need to update this blog a little more regularly and exercise my mind.I guess you can
say and I think blogging or writing more can help with that.
&nbsp;
I'm still thinking on what I can do to improve this website maybe make it a little more appealing.
