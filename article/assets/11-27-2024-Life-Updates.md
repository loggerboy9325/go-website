## About

It's been a bit since I've posted so I figured I would.

It's almost thanksgiving which is nice. I've been in a rut lately but I'm trying to learn something new every day.
I've taken a liking to rust but I think for right now I'm better off still continuing with go.
I think in the future I will definitely start to learn it.

## Job updates

---

I've kinda slowed down on my job applications. I did apply to a amazon data center near me that I have confidence in.
I applied to a data center tech role. Just have to hear back its been about 12 days since I applied.
I did apply to a internship role that I thought I was good for but I think my job application wasn't good enough which is fine.

## Website updates

---

I plan to add more features to this website like maybe a RRS feed in future.
